# Double Loot AFK Exotic Class Item Farm

## About the Macro

This macro farms exotic class items fully automatically by opening chests in the Pale Heart.

There have been other macros similar to this recently (inluding ones where you can tab out while you use them, more info on that below) however this one is different in that it collects 2 chests every time instead of 1. This small change makes the macro much more efficent (nearly 2x) but also much more complex. 

Because of this increase in complexity the in game settings and setup matter much more than with similar macros, so be sure to fully read through and follow the instructions below.
